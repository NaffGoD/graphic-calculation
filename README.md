# graphic-calculation
To create a project, you must use the "project of existing code" Visual Studio.

Information for calculations can be recorded using the keyboard or using a mouse. You can enter it in a special dialog box, click the confirm button.

The result is displayed in several stages. When you click on "Run", the data enters the function and is calculated. After that, the result is returned and saved in a new dialog box, which can be called up by clicking on the "Result" button. If you click on the "Info" button, you can see information about the developer of the program. You can also work with files and perform basic operations by selecting them in the "File" menu. This is where you can save the result to a * .txt file that will appear in the project folder by clicking the "Save" button. Once created, you can open it with the “Open” button and rename it with the “Rename” button. To exit the program window, you must use the "Exit" button.

If Dll3.dll is not found by the project in the directory, an error will be displayed on the screen and calculations in the program will not take place.
